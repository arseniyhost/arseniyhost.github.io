						<li>Development of methods for creating integrated process control systems for power units of TPPs and NPPs, where jointly solving technological, economic and diagnostic control problems:
							<ul>
								<li>control and registration (collection and processing of information entered through the communication complex with the facility (CSR), information exchange on the unit’s local network, information exchange with external systems, information display, signaling of violations, control of generator parameters, registration (archiving and documentation) of information;</li>
								<li>maintenance of protections and interlocks (monitoring of protections and interlocks (KZB), centralized testing of protections (COZ);</li>
								<li>applied tasks (calculation and analysis of technical and economic indicators (TEC) of equipment, calculation of unmeasured parameters;</li>
								<li>monitoring of safety parameters (continuous (in real time) displaying to the operator enough information to determine the safety status of the power unit, information support for the operator’s activities to prevent and localize emergencies, control the release of radioactivity during normal operation, in the event of and after design basis accidents);</li>
								<li>information and reference (issuing recommendations on the management of technological equipment in transient operation of a power unit, providing reference information on technological equipment and means of industrial control systems of a power unit);</li>
								<li>functioning support (diagnostics of the state of hardware and software of the IVS, management of the functioning of the IVS, metrological calibration of the measuring channels);</li>
								<li>automated settings (generation of database structures, input, structuring and editing of source data, generation of configuration data. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Ecological monitoring of the environment, information interaction in the power unit-power plant-power system.</li>
						<li>Development and implementation of a multifunctional integrated multilevel system of internal reactor control SVRK-M for power units with VVER-1000 reactors with redundancy of the most important functions and open for further expansion, which allows:
							<ul>
								<li>monitor technological processes in the reactor installation (RU) and maintain the parameters of these processes within the framework established by the regulations for safe operation of nuclear power plants;</li>
								<li>timely detect the output of switchgear parameters that define the boundaries of safe operation beyond the permitted boundaries and alert operational personnel;</li>
								<li>provide information support for optimizing the passage of technological processes of switchgear in transient conditions;</li>
								<li>monitoring the performance and metrological characteristics of the measuring channels of the SVRK-M during operation of the power unit;</li>
								<li>archiving the work of the reactor core and the state of the coolant of the 1st circuit.</li>
